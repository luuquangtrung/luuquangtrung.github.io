Starting in January 2026, I have been serving as Co-Coordinator of the Industry Communities for the IEEE ComSoc Next-Generation Networking and Internet Technical Committee (NGNI-TC).

Objectives of the NGNI-TC Industry Communities:
* **Bridge the Gap:** Facilitate active dialogue between academic researchers and industry practitioners within the NGNI TC domain.
* **Visibility:** Increase the representation of industry members in NGNI-TC activities (conferences, workshops, standards, and publications).
* **Practical Impact:** Focus on testbeds, prototyping, and standardization of next-gen networking and internet technologies (6G, Open RAN, Network AI, Physical AI).
