<!-- Quang-Trung Luu received a B.Eng. in electronics and telecommunications in 2013 from the [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.vn/) (Hanoi, Vietnam).--><html><body>
<p>I am a tenured Assistant Professor (<em>maître de conférences</em> in French) at <a href="https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Paris-Saclay University</a>, France, affiliated with the <a href="https://l2s.centralesupelec.fr/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Laboratory of Signals and Systems of CentraleSupélec</a> for research and the engineering school <a href="https://www.polytech.universite-paris-saclay.fr/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Polytech Paris-Saclay</a> for teaching activities.</p>

<!-- Quang-Trung Luu is a lecturer (a.k.a. assistant professor) at the [School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://seee.hust.edu.vn/), [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://en.hust.edu.vn/). -->

<p>I obtained a Ph.D from <a href="https://l2s.centralesupelec.fr/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CentraleSupélec - Paris-Saclay University</a>, France, in 2021. My thesis was also realized at <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Nokia Bell Labs France</a>, within the CIFRE Ph.D Fellowship program supported by the <a href="https://www.anrt.asso.fr/fr" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">French government (ANRT)</a>. My thesis was awarded the <a href="https://gdr-rsd.fr/laureats-prix-de-these-2022/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2022 Best PhD Dissertation Award on Distributed Systems and Networks</a> by the <a href="https://gdr-rsd.fr/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">French Research Community on Networks and Distributed Systems</a>, and <a href="http://www.sigops-france.fr/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ACM SigOps France</a>.</p>

<p>Prior to joining Paris-Saclay, I was a lecturer at the <a href="https://seee.hust.edu.vn/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering</a>, <a href="https://en.hust.edu.vn/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Hanoi University of Science and Technology</a> (2023 - 2025), and postdoctoral fellow at the University of Avignon and the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), France (2021 - 2023).</p>

<p>My research focuses on improving resource management in next-generation communication networks (5G and beyond), leveraging mathematical optimization and artificial intelligence.</p>

<!-- ; two masters' degrees, one in antenna and telecom devices from Université Paris-Sud (now [Paris-Saclay University](http://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/)) in 2016, and one another in multimedia networking from [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/) in 2017. 

He sequentially conducted postdoctoral research at the [Computer Science Lab of University of Avignon](https://lia.univ-avignon.fr/) (CERI-LIA) and the [Laboratory for Analysis and Architecture of Systems](https://www.laas.fr/public/) of the [French National Centre for Scientific Research](https://www.cnrs.fr/en) (LAAS-CNRS), Toulouse, France. He is now with [School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://seee.hust.edu.vn/), [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://en.hust.edu.vn/).  -->

<!-- My research interests span over networking topics, especially in network modelling, network optimization, resource allocation and orchestration in communication networks.
