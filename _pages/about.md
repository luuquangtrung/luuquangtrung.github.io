<!-- Quang-Trung Luu received a B.Eng. in electronics and telecommunications in 2013 from the [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.vn/) (Hanoi, Vietnam).--> 

I am a tenured Assistant Professor (*maître de conférences* in French) at [Paris-Saclay University](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en), France, affiliated with the [Laboratory of Signals and Systems of CentraleSupélec](https://l2s.centralesupelec.fr/) for research and the engineering school [Polytech Paris-Saclay](https://www.polytech.universite-paris-saclay.fr/) for teaching activities.

<!-- Quang-Trung Luu is a lecturer (a.k.a. assistant professor) at the [School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://seee.hust.edu.vn/), [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://en.hust.edu.vn/). -->

I obtained a Ph.D from [CentraleSupélec - Paris-Saclay University](https://l2s.centralesupelec.fr/), France, in 2021. My thesis was also realized at [Nokia Bell Labs France](https://www.bell-labs.com/), within the CIFRE Ph.D Fellowship program supported by the [French government (ANRT)](https://www.anrt.asso.fr/fr). My thesis was awarded the [2022 Best PhD Dissertation Award on Distributed Systems and Networks](https://gdr-rsd.fr/laureats-prix-de-these-2022/) by the [French Research Community on Networks and Distributed Systems](https://gdr-rsd.fr/), and [ACM SigOps France](http://www.sigops-france.fr/). 

Prior to joining Paris-Saclay, I was a lecturer at the [School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://seee.hust.edu.vn/), [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://en.hust.edu.vn/) (2023 - 2025), and postdoctoral fellow at the University of Avignon and the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), France (2021 - 2023). 

My research focuses on improving resource management in next-generation communication networks (5G and beyond), leveraging mathematical optimization and artificial intelligence.

<!-- ; two masters' degrees, one in antenna and telecom devices from Université Paris-Sud (now [Paris-Saclay University](http://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/)) in 2016, and one another in multimedia networking from [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/) in 2017. 

He sequentially conducted postdoctoral research at the [Computer Science Lab of University of Avignon](https://lia.univ-avignon.fr/) (CERI-LIA) and the [Laboratory for Analysis and Architecture of Systems](https://www.laas.fr/public/) of the [French National Centre for Scientific Research](https://www.cnrs.fr/en) (LAAS-CNRS), Toulouse, France. He is now with [School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://seee.hust.edu.vn/), [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://en.hust.edu.vn/).  -->



<!-- My research interests span over networking topics, especially in network modelling, network optimization, resource allocation and orchestration in communication networks.
 -->

## announcement
I am actively looking for highly motivated undergraduate/graduate students in the area of resource optimization for next-generation wireless networks (Open RAN, 5G/6G+) and applied AI/ML. Should you be interested in these topics, please send your CV to my email.

## research interests
* Applied AI/ML for 5G & beyond: resource allocation, task scheduling
* Open radio access networks (Open RAN): functional splitting, network slicing, traffic steering
* ML for combinatorial network optimization problems (e.g., virtual network embedding, coflow scheduling)
