#### Purpose: 
This course aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to virtual reality (VR), covering theoretical and practical notions on VR systems. Content includes components of virtual reality systems, characteristics of virtual reality, representation and interaction techniques in virtual reality, basic issues and problems in virtual reality including geometric modeling, visual perception, sound, motion perception and representation, and tracking techniques.
In addition to theory through exercises, students will learn and use tools and environments such as Unity to build virtual reality applications. After the course, students have basic knowledge of virtual reality, can use some tools such as Unity, and are able to design and build a virtual reality application on the tools they have learned.
